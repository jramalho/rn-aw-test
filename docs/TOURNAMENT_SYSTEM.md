## Technical Architecture

### Components

#### TournamentLobbyScreen
- Tournament creation interface
- Team selection
- Statistics display
- Tournament history access

#### TournamentBracketScreen
- Bracket visualization
- Round progression tracking
- Match status indicators
- Navigation to battles

#### TournamentBattleScreen
- Battle interface with tournament context
- Integration with battle store
- Automatic tournament advancement
- Tournament-specific UI elements

### State Management

#### TournamentStore (`src/store/tournamentStore.ts`)

Key state:
- `currentTournament`: Active tournament data
- `tournamentHistory`: Completed tournaments
- `isProcessing`: Operation status

Key actions:
- `createTournament()`: Initialize new tournament
- `startTournament()`: Begin bracket progression
- `advanceTournament()`: Process match results
- `cancelTournament()`: Cancel active tournament
- `getTournamentStats()`: Retrieve statistics

### Types

#### Tournament Types (`src/types/tournament.ts`)

```typescript
- Tournament: Complete tournament state
- TournamentParticipant: Player or AI participant
- TournamentMatch: Individual match data
- TournamentRound: Round structure
- TournamentFormat: SINGLE_ELIMINATION | DOUBLE_ELIMINATION | ROUND_ROBIN
- TournamentStatus: REGISTRATION | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED | CANCELLED
```

### AI Simulation

AI vs AI matches are resolved using:
- Team total stat calculations (80% weight)
- Randomness factor (20% weight)
- Winner determination based on combined score

This ensures:
- Stronger teams usually win
- Occasional upsets create excitement
- Fast simulation for non-player matches

## Integration Points

### Team Builder
- Added üèÜ Tournament button
- Validates team is saved before entry
- Direct navigation to tournament lobby

### Navigation
- New tournament routes in AppNavigator
- Proper stack navigation flow
- Back navigation handling

### Battle System
- Tournament battle extends base battle
- Uses existing battle mechanics
- Adds tournament context and UI

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Double Elimination Format**: Losers bracket support
2. **Round Robin Format**: Every team plays every team
3. **Tournament History View**: Browse past tournaments
4. **Leaderboards**: Global or local rankings
5. **Tournament Rewards**: Badges, titles, or special items
6. **Custom Rulesets**: Level caps, type restrictions
7. **Multiplayer Tournaments**: Real player participation
8. **Spectator Mode**: Watch AI tournaments unfold

### Technical Improvements
1. Better bracket visualization for large tournaments
2. Tournament replay system
3. Advanced AI difficulty levels
4. Tournament save/resume functionality
5. Performance optimizations for large participant counts

## Testing

Tests cover:
- Tournament creation with various sizes
- Bracket generation correctness
- AI simulation logic
- State management
- Tournament progression
- Statistics calculation

Run tests:
```bash
npm test -- tournamentStore.test
```

## Accessibility

- All tournament screens support screen readers
- Clear button labels and hints
- Visual indicators for tournament state
- Proper focus management

## Performance Considerations

- AI simulations run synchronously but complete quickly
- Large tournaments (16+ participants) may take a moment to generate
- Bracket rendering optimized for various screen sizes
- State persistence uses AsyncStorage for reliability

## Known Limitations

1. Only Single Elimination currently implemented
2. Tournament can't be paused mid-match
3. No undo/redo for tournament progression
4. Limited to pre-defined participant counts
5. AI simulation is deterministic per match

## Contributing

When extending the tournament system:
1. Maintain backwards compatibility with saved tournaments
2. Add tests for new tournament formats
3. Update this documentation
4. Consider mobile performance
5. Ensure accessibility standards
